Hi everyone!

This is basically my first odin project html & css webpage. I tried to stick to the visual layout and colors they specified adding my own content instead. HTML file has basic div elements, headers and images. 
The CSS file covers what I've understood so far in FlexBox, box-model and other basic styles (fonts, sizes, borders, etc...)
